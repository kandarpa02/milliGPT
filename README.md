microGPT is reflexion of how the vanilla **Transformer** layers were coded in 2017 at **Google**. This is a very low level implementation of GPT with pure **math equations and JAX**. **Attention, Embeddings, Layernorm, FFN** all are implemented from scratch to help people who are new in the field of LLMs and learn its core functionalities rather than importing some prebuild modules.
