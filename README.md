`microGPT` is a reflection of how the original **Transformer** layers were engineered back in 2017 at **Google**. This is a very low-level implementation of **GPT**, built entirely from **math equations and JAX**.
Core components like **Self-Attention, Embeddings, LayerNorm**, and **Feedforward Networks** are implemented from scratch, designed to help newcomers understand the inner workings of **LLMs**, without hiding behind prebuilt abstractions.
